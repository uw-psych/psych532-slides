# What is machine learning (ML)

- A field of science/engineering that builds systems that are capable of learning from experience.
- Very broad and varied, but some common features:
  - Algorithms that learn from data, rather than rule-based, hand-tuned systems.
  - Performance evaluation focused on well-defined quantitative targets.
- A contrast with "traditional inference":
  - Focused on "prediction".
  - Not as much on "explanation" or "understanding".

# The setup

::: {.tiny}
- Let $X$ be a set of independent variables, $n$ rows by $p$ columns.
- Let's assume it's tidy 😊
- $y$ a dependent variable, $n$ entries
- So, in fairly general terms:
- $y = f_\theta(X)$
- Where $f$ is some function and $\theta$ are parameters of this function.
- The goal of ML can be described as defining a procedure that identifies the values of $\theta$
- In some cases, also need to learn the form of $f$

# Types of ML

- Supervised:
  - In this case, we have both $y$ and $X$ measured.
  - Predicting people's chronological age from structural brain differences.
  - Determining whether an email is spam.
  - Predicting a person's rating of a movie based on their rating of other movies.
- Unsupervised:
  - In this case, we only have $X$ ($y$ may be a latent factor).
  - Example from Efron and Diaconis: determining the linear combination of grades that best distinguishes between students.
  - Determining sub-types of autism based on brain structure

# Supervised learning

  - Regression: $y$ is a continuous variable
  - Classification: $y$ is a discrete variable

$R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}} = 1 - \frac{\sum{(y - \hat{y})^2}}{\sum{(y - \bar{y})^2}}$
