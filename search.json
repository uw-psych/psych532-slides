    "text": "David Donoho\n\n\nStatistician who has made fundamental contributions, including huge impact in application of “compressed sensing” in the geosciences.\nTogether with other collaborators (Claerbout, Buckheit) also had impact in defining computational reproducibility. We’ll come back to that in a few weeks.\nThe article starts with a critique of the ~2015 interest in “data science” within universities, and how it was constituted.\nNext, it walks through several milestones in the history of data science in the last 50 years."
