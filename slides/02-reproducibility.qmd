# "Most research findings are false"

Ioannidis 2005, PLoS Medicine

- The main reason is the reliance on p-values for assessing the truth of scientific hypotheses.
- PPV: "positive predictive value", the post-study probability that a research finding is true.
- I.e., the chance it would replicate/generalize.

# "Most research findings are false"

- PPV depends on statistical power (effect size, sample size), but not only.
- The ratio of "true relationships" to "no relationships" tested within a research field.
- Bias: design, analysis and presentation factors that produce false research findings.
- Testing by several independent teams.

# "Most research findings are false"

- The greater the number and the lesser the selection of tested relationships in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true.
- The greater the flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true.
- The greater the financial and other interests and prejudices in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true.
- The hotter a scientific field (with more scientific teams involved), the less likely the research findings are to be true.

"False-positive psychology: Undisclosed flexibility in data collection and analysis allows presenting anything as significant"

# The Open Science Collaboration

- Many concerns, but little hard *evidence*.
- Goal: estimate PPV in psychology research.
- Reproduced 100 studies from prominent psych journals (Psych Sci, JPSP, JEP:LMC).
- Studies/experiments selected using a uniform approach.
- Replications conducted in consultation with original authors.


# Results

- Using null hypothesis rejection as criterion: 35 / 97 replications.
- Using effect size overlap 30 / 73 replications.
- Overall replication more prevalent for cognitive psych than social psych.
